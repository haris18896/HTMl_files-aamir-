                  In the event that EastVPN is acquired by, or merged with, a third-party entity, EastVPN may, without your
                  prior written consent, assign this agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to a new corporate entity,
                  who shall be bound by these same rights and obligations. Any assignment not in accordance with this Agreement
                  shall be void.

                <p>
                  EastVPN may update/revise the Terms from time to time without notice. If you continue to use EastVPN's
                  Services (content, website, apps, or software) after these changes take effect, then you agree to the revised
                  Terms. You understand and agree that it is your obligation to review these Terms from time to time in order to
                  stay informed on current rules and obligations. EastVPN will make every effort to inform its users about the
                  change in these Terms, whenever they happen, by email or by posting a notice in the user's area to review.
                  However, the company cannot be held liable for it. Using the Services after changes become effective means that
                  you agree to the new Terms.
